# Features needed
* Delete saved connection details

* Delete table, column, and rows (right click options)

* ContentView (Refresh isnâ€™t getting the correct results when new rows are available)

* Make Left bar on both ConnectionView and MainLayout be scrollable

* export results table as xml/csv

* make columns expand better, right now everything is uniform but longer entries should be a bit bigger (min/max columns)

* style table items by type..color coded if possible. Strings, Integer, NULL, and datetimes could be styled different

* Sort results table by column asc/desc

* Edit fields in results table
